      <p>
        Trale utilizes state-of-the-art security and end-to-end encryption to provide private messaging and Internet calling services to users worldwide (“Services”). Your calls and messages are always encrypted, so they can never be shared or viewed by anyone but yourself and the intended recipients.

      <p>
        Contacts. Trale can optionally discover which contacts in your address book are Trale users, using a service designed to protect the privacy of your contacts. Information from the contacts on your device may be cryptographically hashed and transmitted to the server in order to determine which of your contacts are registered.

        Managing your information. You can manage your personal information in Trale’s application Settings. For example, you can update your profile information or choose to enable additional privacy features like a Registration Lock PIN.

If you use other Third-Party Services like YouTube, Spotify, Giphy, etc. in connection with our Services, their Terms and Privacy Policies govern your use of those services.
